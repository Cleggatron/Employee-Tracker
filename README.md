  ## Installation

  Once the repo has been cloned you will need to run the command `npm i` in the command line. This will install the necessary dependencies. You will also need to create a .env file at the top level of the file structure. This will need to house the following data: DB_NAME=<database name here>  DB_PASSWORD=<your mysql password here>  DB_USER=<your mysql username here>. Once this is done you will need to naavigate to the db folder. Initialise mysql and run the source and seed files. You will need to update the seed file with your won pre-existing data. 

  ## Usage
